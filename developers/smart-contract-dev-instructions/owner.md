# Owner

**Staking pool owners have the following abilities:**

1. Can change the **‘effective interest rate’** of the staking pool at any time.

2. Can set the **‘eligibilityAmount**’ of Rookie/Professional staking pools.

3. Can transfer their ownership of the smart contracts to another address.

4. Can renounce ownership of the smart contract, thereby making the ‘**0x0**’ address as the owner. \(Once ownership is transferred, the original smart contract owner cannot perform any of the above actions, and the smart contracts can no longer be adjusted\).
