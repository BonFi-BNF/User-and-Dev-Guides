# Withdraw

## Before you begin

**Prerequisite**: 

User\(s\) should have staked in at least 1 of the available staking pools. Furthermore, the lock period is expired, or the staking pool reached maturity.

## **Withdrawal methodology**

Users can withdraw their staked assets from the pool once the lock period is over by calling the withdrawal function. The rewards will be paid out simultaneously. 

**Emergency Withdrawal:**

The current withdraw function will check for the rewards generated by the user for the lock period. It will proceed to token distribution only if these rewards are less than the `rewardBalance` \(reward tokens remaining in the smart contract\). Users can call the `emergencyWithdrawal` function after the lock period to withdraw the staked tokens without any rewards to prevent any potential risk of stuck user tokens in the smart contract.

**Important**: Before using the `emergencyWithdrawal` function, contact the BonFi DAO Council to troubleshoot the issue.
