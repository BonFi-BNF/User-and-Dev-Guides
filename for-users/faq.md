# FAQ

## **What is BonFi?**

BonFi is a multilayered open finance liquidity mining service platform complemented by the AI-powered BonVest, a professional cryptocurrency liquidity mining solution. It expands the DeFi financial product offering by combining smart contract staking and a managed cryptocurrency liquidity pool to achieve sustainable benefits for users.

## **Who governs the BonFi Platform?**

The BonFi DAO places governance, voting rights, and the organization's DAO Council election into the community's hands. The governance structure will provide organizational control to a supervisory council and the community, who will have greater control over the future direction of the BonFi ecosystem. This means a decentralized group of people govern the BonFi Platform and act on good faith of the DAO members / token holders. With this, users will be able to directly influence vital organizational decisions, such as the launch of new DeFi products, proposed protocol changes, and more.

## **What are BNF Tokens?**

BNF is an ERC-20 token used for governing the BonFi platform. The BNF token allows holders to vote \(or delegate their voting power\) on proposals for updates or changes to the BonFi protocol. With this, community members can directly influence critical organizational decisions that impact BonFi’s future direction.

## **What is the difference between BonFi and other DeFi products?**

Existing DeFi services primarily include savings, lending, and staking of digital assets. After experimenting with various solutions, we observed a few key issues that negatively impact user experience, including but not limited to a lack of user empowerment, rigid infrastructure, and a lack of features. Furthermore, the promised yields are not based on market data.

The BonFi platform provides a more long-term sustainable solution. We enable the crypto community to seize the advantages of Artificial Intelligence and Quantitative Analysis to build a more rewarding and decentralized system by integrating our proprietary BonVest.

You will unlock the entire selection of BonFi Native DeFi Offerings, gain access to recommended Third Party DeFi Offerings, and the BonVest. The latter will give comprehensive market insights that will help you to optimize your portfolio.

## **How do I unlock access to all BonVest Platform Features?**
