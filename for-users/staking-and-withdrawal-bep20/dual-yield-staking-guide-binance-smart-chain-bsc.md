## How to stake 

{% hint style="danger" %}
**CAUTION: DO NOT DIRECTLY SEND TOKENS TO THE STAKING CONTRACT, ONLY USE THE PROVIDED USER INTERFACE!**

**ANY TOKEN SENT DIRECTLY WILL BE LOST**
{% endhint %}

**Step 1:** Navigate to the DeFi tab and select a Dual Yield pool to stake in and click on _Stake_.

**Step 2:** Select the asset you would like to stake. If you want to stake both assets select _All._ Enter the amount you would like to stake and click _STAKE._ 

\(Caution the amount cannot exceed your current wallet holdings\).

**Step 3:** A pop-up will appear waiting for confirmation. Navigate to MetaMask or WalletConnect to _Confirm_  the transaction. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed while the transaction is being processed.

While waiting, you can either minimize the pop-up or check the transaction status on Etherscan.

**Step 4:** After the transaction is completed your  tokens are locked in the staking pool until maturity of the contract. You can track your minimum term, maturity and earned rewards in the Native DeFi product dashboard.

**Step 5:** If a users chose to stake only one token, they will have the option to stake the other token from the Dual Yield pair at a later stage. Simply click on _Stake_ to stake the paired token to the staking contract.

### **Important**

* **Users can only stake 1 time in each pool**
* **Staking requires the users to interact with the staking contract twice**. The first transaction approves the spend limit \(i.e. maximum approved staking amount\), while the second transaction deposits/locks the funds in the staking contract. If a user only interacts with the contract once, funds will remain in their wallet unstaked. To avoid this, users are encouraged to check their balance after staking and/or manually click on _Stake_ to confirm that staking was completed successfully.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a user stakes a total of 2500 BNF or more across different pools, but does not meet the minimum requirement of staking a minimum of 2500 BNF in the Rookie, Professional or Flex Staking Pools, access to the full platform remains restricted. To gain full access, users need to stake 2500 BNF in the Rookie or Professional Staking Pools.
