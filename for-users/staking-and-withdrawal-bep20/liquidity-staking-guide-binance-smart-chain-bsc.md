# Liquidity Staking Guide - Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\)

## Why liquidity staking yields the highest APY

Liquidity staking is a fantastic product that allows users to **earn double rewards** on providing liquidity to the PancakeSwap BNF-BNB pair. As a liquidity provider \(LP\), users receive higher staking APY **and** a share of the 0.17% pool fee, distributed pro-rata to all LPs for every trade.

It is the ultimate way to earn passive rewards because users will receive high BNF APY rewards and additional BNF and BNB as part of the pool reward. Liquidity staking provides double incentivizes to LPs as they earn double rewards passively.

## Before you begin

{% hint style="warning" %}
Disclaimer: Use Smart Contracts at your own Risk 
{% endhint %}

As part of BonFi's comprehensive offering, the platform offers **audited liquidity staking** as part of the Native DeFi Products. This offering is accessible to all users of the BonFi Platform. However, to unlock all features, users must stake a minimum of 2500 BNF in either the Rookie or Professional staking pools. 

## **What you need**

* BEP-20 wallet 
* BNB \(used for gas fees\)
* BEP-20 token assets \(i.e. BNF\)
* LP token \(i.e. BNF-BNB pair CAKE-V2\) 
* MetaMask app

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure your wallet holding your BEP-20 assets has a sufficient BNB balance to cover gas fees
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**CAKE-V2 tokens are not the same as CAKE governance tokens. Each PancakeSwap pool has a dedicated CAKE-V2 token that is associated with the relevant trading pair \(e.g. BNF-BNB\)**

**Follow the guide to access the correct CAKE-V2 tokens for the BNF-BNB trading pair**

{% endhint %}

Step 2: Paste the following **Token Contract Address:** [**0xca14caf9e8dd2793e7010fc48dfe6c6af8445136** ](https://bscscan.com/token/0xca14caf9e8dd2793e7010fc48dfe6c6af8445136?a=0x44e349534f785053844519db0a01a420106bc690)and click _Next_.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2815%29.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:**

**CAKE-V2 tokens are BEP-20 standard**, which means that they can only be transferred to BSC wallet addresses.

**Do not send CAKE-V2 tokens to exchanges**. The CAKE-V2 tokens are not CAKE governance tokens and are not tradable!

**CAKE-V2 tokens are your claim to the BNF and BNB** supplied to the liquidity pool. Ensure proper wallet keys management. Losing CAKE-V2 tokens may result in losing your BNF and BNB.
{% endhint %}

## How to stake

{% hint style="danger" %}
**CAUTION: DO NOT DIRECTLY SEND CAKE-V2 TOKENS TO THE STAKING CONTRACT, ONLY USE THE PROVIDED USER INTERFACE!**

**ANY TOKEN SENT DIRECTLY WILL BE LOST**
{% endhint %}

**Step 1:** Navigate to the BonFi platform &gt; DeFi and select the Liquidity Staking pool. Familiarize yourself with the staking terms before proceeding. 

**Step 2:** Click on Approve.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2833%29.png)

**Step 3:** A pop-up will appear waiting for confirmation. Navigate to MetaMask or WalletConnect to _Confirm_ the spending limit and wait for the transaction to be confirmed while the transaction is being processed.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

While waiting, you can either minimize the pop-up or check the transaction status on Etherscan.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

**Step 4:** After the transaction was approved a new pop-up will appear highlighting that you are now able to continue the process to stake. Click on _Stake_ to proceed or _Cancel_ to stop.

**NOTE**: In the event that the pop-up does not appear automatically, manually click _Stake_ a second time and continue with the process \(ensure to select the staking pool, that was selected in Step 1\)

After the transaction is successful, please click on the Confirm button and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

**Step 5:** A pop-up will appear waiting for confirmation. Navigate to MetaMask or WalletConnect to _Confirm_ the amount of BNF and wait for the transaction to be confirmed while the transaction is being processed.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2818%29.png)

**Step 6:** After the transaction is completed your BNF tokens are locked in the staking pool until the maturity of the contract. You can track your minimum term, maturity, and earned rewards in the Native DeFi product dashboard.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2814%29.png)

### **Important**

* **Users can only stake 1 time in each staking pool**
* CAKE-V2 tokens will continue to earn pool rewards \(0.17% pro-rated transaction fees\), even after the maturity of the pool
* **Staking requires the users to interact with the staking contract twice**. The first transaction approves the spending limit \(i.e. maximum approved staking amount\), while the second transaction deposits/locks the funds in the staking contract. If a user only interacts with the contract once, funds will remain in their wallet un-staked. To avoid this, users are encouraged to check their balance after staking and/or manually click on _Stake_ to confirm that staking was completed successfully.
