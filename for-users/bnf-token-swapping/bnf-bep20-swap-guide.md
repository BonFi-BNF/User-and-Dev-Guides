## Prerequisites

In order to swap your BNF tokens across different blockchain protocols \(e.g. ETH to BSC\), you will require to hold a small amount of NerveNetwork \(NVT\) tokens to facilitate the swap. Each cross-chain swap transaction requires less than 10 NVT \(less than $1\).

## Swap Guide: Step-by-step

**Step 1:** Go to Nerve Web Wallet: [https://wallet.nerve.network](https://wallet.nerve.network)

**Step 2:** “Create” a Nerve account or “Import” your Nerve account.

**NOTE**: Make sure to Backup all your wallet address details. You will need this information to access your wallet address in the future.

**Step 3:** Navigate to the “Account” tab and press the + button to add additional crypto assets to your personal Asset list.

**Step 5:** Deposit NVT Tokens to your Nerve wallet address. You can choose to withdraw NVT tokens from an exchange or send it from another NVT wallet address. The NVT Tokens are used to cover the cross-chain swapping transaction fees.

**Step 6:** Deposit BNF Tokens \(ERC20\) to your Nerve wallet address. Search for BNF \(Ethereum\) and press Cross Into.

**Step 7:** You will see a summary of your BNF account affiliated with your Nerve account. If this is the first transaction, then a new BNF \(ERC20\) account will be created. There are two different methods to deposit BNF tokens to your Nerve account:

1. MetaMask Integration: Link your MetaMask account directly to top up your Nerve Account.
2. Manual Transfer: Directly transfer tokens to the designated wallet address. 

**Note:** Make sure that you have sufficient ETH in your wallet to cover the transaction fees.

Step 8: After completing the transaction, wait for a few minutes to see your updated account balance. Once your account balance is updated, press on ‘Cross Out’ to perform a cross-chain swap \(e.g. ETH to BSC\).

**Step 10:** You have successfully completed the BNF cross-chain transaction. Your ETH tokens are burned and you have received new BNF tokens on the BSC Network on a 1:1 basis. 

**Note:** Your wallet may sometimes not display the newly minited BNF \(BEP20\) tokens. Please add the following token contract address:
