### **Important**

* **Users can only stake 1 time in each pool**
* To unlock the full BonFi platform, user need to stake atleast 2500 BNF in either the Rookie,  Professional or Flex Staking Pool
* **Staking requires the users to interact with the staking contract twice**. The first transaction approves the spend limit \(i.e. maximum approved staking amount\), while the second transaction deposits/locks the funds in the staking contract. If a user only interacts with the contract once, funds will remain in their wallet unstaked. To avoid this, users are encouraged to check their balance after staking and/or manually click on _Stake_ to confirm that staking was completed successfully.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a user stakes a total of 2500 BNF or more across different pools, but does not meet the minimum requirement of staking a minimum of 2500 BNF in the Rookie, Professional or Flex Staking Pools, access to the full platform remains restricted. To gain full access, users need to stake 2500 BNF in the Rookie or Professional Staking Pools.
