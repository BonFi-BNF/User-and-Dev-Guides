# Connect your Wallet

## **What you need**

* ERC-20 wallet 
* ETH \(used for gas fees\)
* ERC-20 token assets \(e.g. BNF, SFI, VALUE, YFI, etc.\)
* MetaMask widget or WalletConnect app

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure your wallet holding your ERC-20 assets has a sufficient ETH balance to pay for gas fees
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**The BonFi Platform is fully non-custodial, this means we never ask or request your private keys**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Remember your wallet address, because any platform features or native staking offerings are linked to this specific wallet address and do not carry over to a new address**
{% endhint %}

## **How to create a new account** 

If you would like to create a new UserName or account, simply use an unused ERC-20 wallet address.
