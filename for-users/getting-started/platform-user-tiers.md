# Platform User Tiers

## What are Platform User Tiers?

The BonFi Platform has different user tiers that each have their own perks. Currently, the BonFi Platform employs the following two user tiers:

**1\) Rookie User:** Each user will start their journey as a Rookie User. This user tier gives you access to basic platform features, including a limited selection of BonFi Native DeFi offerings, Crypto News, Fear & Greed Index, Portfolio Overview, Governance, and BonVest Preview.

**2\) Professional User:** This user tier gives you full access to all features within our platform. You will unlock the entire selection of BonFi Native DeFi Offerings, gain access to recommended Third Party DeFi Offerings, and the BonVest. The latter will give comprehensive market insights that will help you to optimize your portfolio.
