# Product Offerings

## **Abstract**

BonFi provides an interactive dashboard that users interact with; it functions as a hub, connecting different functions and features. Within two clicks, our users can use the platform for various purposes. Users can check their portfolio, engage with BonFi Native DeFi offerings and take advantage of exclusive BonVest’s DeFi product recommendations. They can also access sophisticated market analyses and make use of BonAI’s prediction algorithms.

Our platform is not text-heavy and takes a visual approach. We present clear overviews of all essential information and data points that can help users optimize their portfolios.

**Here is a detailed overview of BonFi’s various product offerings:**
