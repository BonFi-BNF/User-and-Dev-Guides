# What is BonFi?

## **What do we do?**

The BonFi platform functions as a comprehensive DeFi aggregator that streamlines the DeFi value proposition and popularizes digital assets. Users gain access to various native BonFi DeFi products and recommended third-party DeFi products based on advanced algorithms that continuously analyze many data sources, including but not limited to crypto market data, behavioral data, and risk sentiments. These different data points are integrated into the back-end, powering a sophisticated prediction engine that helps DeFi users contextualize market information.

Besides offering various DeFi products paired with an associated prediction engine, our platform also helps users gain a comprehensive overview of the DeFi market. The BonVest enables users to optimize their crypto portfolios by presenting relevant data, allowing you to understand individual DeFi projects and the overall DeFi market quickly.

## **What is our overarching goal?**

Based on general market surveys and statistics, we recognize that the average retail investor does not have a general understanding of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Therefore, it is too ambitious to expect prospective users to fully grasp the complex fundamentals of existing DeFi solutions. This perceived complexity impedes user adoption and the overall long-term growth of this niche industry. To attract a broader audience, we believe there is a strong need to streamline the user experience.

Our mission is to be the go-to platform for users looking for a decentralized liquidity mining solution.     Through the BonFi Platform, the crypto community can seize the advantages of Artificial Intelligence, Data Oracles, and Quantitative Analysis to optimize their liquidity mining pool strategies. We do not position ourselves as a direct competitor to any DeFi service provider but rather a partner that facilitates user growth across various protocols and platforms. 

**BonFi Platform's key design features:**

* As an open finance liquidity mining platform, BonFi is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses an ERC-20 token denoted as BonFi \(BNF\) for its governance.
* Users interact directly with either the BonFi Platform or with third-party DeFi Platforms included in the BonVest.
* The BonVest utilizes state-of-the-art technology, utilizing AI, Data Oracles, and Quantitative Analysis to provide users with market information, risk analysis, and multilateral DeFi access.
* Users gain access to the BonVest through smart contract staking assets on the BonFi Platform, using a Tier system.
* The BonFi Platform is non-custodial, and users are always in control of their token assets and private keys.
